        <h5> 
          I am a recent graduate with a Master's in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Southampton. 
          Through my journey at university, I started to realise that the software integration to any design was what brought life
          into a component and this was an alluring incentive for me to learn more about software engineering.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Initially,  I started learning new programming languages and frameworks to make a cool portfolio website but
          I have now become more engrossed into learning more and more frameworks to enrich my skills and knowledge. 
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I am an inquisitive individual who has an interest in machine learning. 
          I am interested in using these models to make peculiar and interesting projects as shown with the use of speech recognition in this website.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Across my projects, I have come to amass some skills and they are stated below. 
          I have come to appreciate back-end frameworks and I am currently learning about databases for future projects.
